Consider an -element array, , where each index  in the array contains a reference to an array of  integers
(where the value of  varies from array to array). See the Explanation section below for a diagram.

Given , you must answer  queries. Each query is in the format i j, where  denotes an index in array 
and  denotes an index in the array located at . For each query, find and print the value of element 
in the array at location  on a new line.


Input Format

The first line contains two space-separated integers denoting the respective values of 
(the number of variable-length arrays) and  (the number of queries).

Each line  of the  subsequent lines contains a space-separated sequence in the format k a[i]0 a[i]1 â€¦ a[i]k-1 
describing the -element array located at .
Each of the  subsequent lines contains two space-separated integers describing the 
respective values of  (an index in array ) and  (an index in the array referenced by ) for a query.

#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    // get length of array 'a' and number of queries
    int n, q;
    cin >> n >> q;

    // create vector of vectors
    vector<vector<int> > a(n);

    // fill each 2D vector i with k_i values
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        // get the length k of the vector at a[i]
        int k;
        cin >> k;

        // fill the vector with k values
        a[i].resize(k);
        for (int j = 0; j < k; j++) {
            cin >> a[i][j];
        }
    }

    // run queries on a
    for (int q_num = 0; q_num < q; q_num++) {
        // get i, j as the 'query' to get a value from a
        int i, j;
        cin >> i >> j;
        cout << a[i][j] << endl;
    }

    return 0;
